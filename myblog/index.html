      <h3>The world is fighting covid-19. At present India is the worst affected country, with new cases crossing over 4 lac per day. It is very difficult to predict what turn it will take. Few medical experts are fearing spreading of third wave if action to contain the epidemic spread is not taken up effectively. The economy has been hit badly. The mental stress of adults losing job, young children not able to go to school, college fear of unseen enemy every where has made the life miserable. Many families have lost their earning member  have brought unimaginable hard days ahead of them. Many chidren have lost there parents and the society is facing a new challenge of rehabilitaion of these young citizens. As compared to western countries where health facility is far better than in India, India is fighting with its limited resources for protecting its population. Vaccination is also slow due to slow supply of vaccine.Making the things worst is the authorities unable to impose lock down timely and letting the relious accummulation and election spread the virus unchecked. Irony is that the chosen representaive have led the peoples to this disastrous situation. <br> It is surprising that China the land from where the virus originated has been able to effectively checke the virus and not a single case is reported on this date.  At this time of crisis every one has to be responsible . Maintain social distancing, wash hans regularly, utilise minimum resouces so that it can be made avaiable to the areas wher it is  most needed. I pray to the almighty that the world may get rid of the virus soon. At this time of distress we nee a leader like Mahatma Gandhi who could have mobilised the inner spitit of the mass to fight the situation as one nation.</h3>
